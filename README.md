Two notes: I use a couple of swear words, because this is mostly for my own amusement; and this should not be taken as me endorsing Maxim's Hot 100 list or the sexist perspective it represents. I'm with Tina Fey (from Bossypants):
> Photoshop itself is not evil. Just like Italian salad dressing is not inherently evil, until you rub it all over a desperate young actress and stick her on the cover of Maxim, pretending to pull her panties down. (That “thumbs in the panties” move is the worst. Really? It’s not enough that they got greased up and in their panties for you, Maxim?)

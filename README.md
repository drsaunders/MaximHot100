This is a for-fun project I did that is all contained in this 
### [Jupyter Notebook: hot100.ipynb](https://github.com/drsaunders/MaximHot100/blob/master/hot100.ipynb)

Two notes: I use a couple of swear words, because this is mostly for my own amusement; and this should not be taken as me endorsing Maxim's Hot 100 list or the sexist perspective it represents.
